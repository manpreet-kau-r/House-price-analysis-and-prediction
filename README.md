# House-price-analysis-and-prediction
Description : 
Goal of the project is to use regression techniques in order to estimate the sale price of a house given the features and pricing data for around 3,000 houses sold in past. 

Tkinter library is used for GUI interface of the project.
1.	EDA
2.	Build a simple model
3.	Try various features on a simple model
4.	Build a complex model
5.	Train with promising features

We have analyzed the effect of various parameters on sale price of a house and selected those parameters which have maximum effect. Using these parameters, we applied machine learning regression algorithms to predict the price of a house. 

â€¢	There were 80 total attributes in the dataset, some of which we derived from current columns. I used 23 attributes in our models.
